CodeCraft - AI-Powered "Rubber Duck Debugging" on Steroids 🦆💡

CodeCraft is an AI-powered conversational mentor designed to help users improve their programming skills by guiding them through problem-solving rather than simply providing answers. By using Socratic questioning, visual metaphors, and gamified debugging techniques, CodeCraft teaches debugging, design, and computational thinking. It's like having an interactive, AI-driven mentor that helps you solve problems and develop critical thinking skills! 🧠

Features 🌟
1. Explain Your Problem 🤔
Users describe their coding issues in natural language (e.g., “My Python loop keeps crashing”). Instead of providing a direct solution, CodeCraft engages the user with thought-provoking questions that promote problem-solving:

“What happens if you print the loop index before it crashes?”

“Let’s hypothesize why index 5 might be problematic.”

2. Visualize Concepts 🌈
For complex concepts, CodeCraft provides dynamic visualizations and metaphors to help users grasp difficult topics:

Recursion: CodeCraft generates an interactive comic strip with a Russian doll metaphor that unpacks itself to explain recursion.

Pointers: Using a “treasure map” analogy, CodeCraft animates how pointers lead to memory addresses and values.

3. Gamified Debugging 🎮
CodeCraft transforms errors into engaging puzzles, encouraging users to think critically and learn from their mistakes:

“Your ‘NullPointerException’ is a locked door. Find 3 clues in the code to discover the missing key.”

As users solve problems, they earn badges for mastering specific concepts (e.g., “Loop Ninja” for fixing 10 iteration bugs).

4. Project Roadmaps 📅
Users outline their coding goals (e.g., “I want to build a weather app”), and CodeCraft generates a customized roadmap to guide their learning:

Week 1: Learn API calls 🌐

Week 2: Build UI mockups 📱

Week 3: Handle errors ❌

Mini-challenges are provided along the way to reinforce learning.

Usage 🚀
Start a new session: Upon launching the app, you can begin a new debugging session by describing your problem in the input prompt.

Ask for guidance: The AI will ask clarifying questions to better understand your issue and help you think through potential solutions.

View visualizations: If you’re struggling with specific programming concepts (like recursion or pointers), ask CodeCraft to generate a visualization to aid understanding.

Track progress: As you solve problems, track your achievements, unlock badges, and follow the step-by-step roadmap tailored to your coding project.

Special Thanks 🙏
A huge thank you to the developers and contributors who make this project possible! Your hard work and creativity help bring this unique learning experience to life.

Inspired by the idea of "Rubber Duck Debugging" 🦆, CodeCraft teaches programming and debugging through conversation, allowing learners to grow by solving problems through critical thinking rather than just being given answers.
